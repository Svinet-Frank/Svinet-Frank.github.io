            <h1>Which Operating System Should You Choose?</h1>
            <h2>An operating system (OS) is the backbone software of your computer, it’s what interprets the binary code (1’s and 0’s) into the visuals you see when using your PC.</h2>

                <h3>WHY CHOOSE WINDOWS</h3>
                <p>Windows is for the general consumer, since it is very intuitive, and the preferred platform for most software developers to release their products on. That is simply because it is the most popular, and it has the biggest percentage of users out of all the OS's out there.</p>
                <p>It is the only OS to support all the games you might want to play, if not console exclusive of course. Some products are however ported to Apple products if possible, although games are a tough port, because of DirectX which is not "Apple friendly".</p>
                <p>Windows is the best choice for an all-around computer experience.</p>
                <h3>WINDOWS HISTORY</h3>
                <p>Windows is without a doubt, the most widely used OS in the world. The first edition, Windows 1.0 was release the 20. of November 1985, by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</p>
                <p> Until the year 2000, Windows was not a standalone OS, but rather build on the back of MS-DOS (Microsoft Disc Operating System) as the visual representation of it. </p>
                <p>After the last MS-DOS based system, Windows ME in 2000. A counterpart, build on the commercial Windows NT version, was released for the general consumer named Windows 2000. From there sprang the operating system to take over the world. You guessed it, Windows XP.</p>
                <p>Today we have windows 10, which presumably will be the last windows for many years to come.</p>

                    <img alt="Apple Logo" src="images/apple.png">
                </div>
                <h3>WHY CHOOSE OS X</h3>
                <p>The person who chooses and Apple computer is doing it for the beautiful design. Some people also prefer the way iTunes and many of their products and apps work in unison, however it can also feel limited and restricted in its capabilities.</p>
                <p>They also aren’t built for games any more, like in the old days, since most Apple computers come with an integrated graphics card, which is very feeble in comparison to an external graphics card.</p>
                <p>If you have a lot of money to spend, you can get a Macbook Pro with a better graphics card, but it still is not meant for gaming, since DirectX prohibits many of today’s games being ported to OS X. It gets slowly better though.
                </p>
                <h3>OS X HISTORY</h3>
                <p>MacOS or OS X as it is known today is manufactured by Apple. It is the operating system used on all Macintosh computers since their first in 1984.</p>
                <p>The first 9 versions didn’t change all that much. It wasn’t until 2001 when Mac OS X came along, that major changes in the code were made. Later they dropped the “Mac” in the front, and it is now known only as OS X. The X standing for the number 10 in roman numerals.</p>
                <p>In the early days, Apples computers were built with games in mind, in big contrast with today. Apple computers today however, are built around their design. Both the physical and software.

                <h3>WHY CHOOSE LINUX</h3>
                <p>Linux is for the person who would like a lot of freedom to do what they want with their pc. It is 100% customizable if you can code the features you want.</p>
                <p>It is a good fit for programmers of various software, but also for the general consumer, since these days, it is very easy to use, compared to its beginning back in the 90’s.</p>
                <p>It is also a much more secure OS than Windows or Apple, and best of all, it's totally free.</p>
                <p>Initially I wasn't gonna mention this, but there might also be a certain "status" in using Linux, if you want to signal to the world that you "know what you're doing" when it comes to computers.</p>
                <h3>LINUX HISTORY</h3>
                <p>Linus was developed in 1991 by a 21-year-old finish computer science student named Linus Torvalds.</p>
                <p>He designed it specifically for the hardware he was using at the time. And that is how it is seen today.</p>
                <p>It is an operating system where you must code all your own features, and is therefore the most customizable operating system you can get.</p>
                <p>In the beginning it was very restricted if you couldn’t code it yourself. Today however there is a lot of pre-programmed extensions, like apps from the App-store. So you can get started without having extensive knowledge of coding.
