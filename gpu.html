            <h1>Which Graphics Card For Gaming?</h1>
            <h2>Choosing a GPU can be tricky. This article is a short summary of the newest nVidia Geforce series.</h2>

                <h3>Geforce GTX Series</h3>
                <p>The obvious choice, and the one focused on in this article is the nVidia Geforce series. A new series is released almost every year and the cards in the current are called the GTX 1050, 1060, 1070 and 1080.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the camp is ATI’s Radeon series which can be a good alternative. However, nVidia is dominating the marked for good reason.</p>
                <h3>1050 & 1060</h3>
                <p>Without the GTX 1050, which is for laptops, there are three steps to consider. A 1060 will give you the minimum of the GTX series, but is definitely not a meager choice. It is still able to give you a minimum of 60fps in games such as CS:GO, Overwatch and Battlefield 1.</p>
                <h3>1070</h3>
                <p>The next card in line is the GTX 1070 which is of course a step up from the 1060. It will guarantee a smooth and stutter free experience in any game currently on the market, in Full HD. It can even run certain games in 4K resolution, however not on maximum settings, and with a drop in fps, depending on how demanding the game in question is. </p>
                <p> A low demanding game like League of Legends would be no struggle at all, to reach a steady minimum over 120 fps.</p>

            <section id="mid">
                <h3>1080</h3>
                <p>At the top of the line is the GTX 1080, which is the ultimate graphics card on the market for gamers. It comes in many varieties, like the others. GTX 1080 STRIX, MSI, EVGA and so on. You can even buy a 1080ti which is basically they “supercharged” version of it, but let’s just focus on the basics for now.</p>
                <p>You will of course be able to run any game at maximum settings, and even charter the territories of 4k with close to 60fps for the most part. However, and here is the catch, you will need two GTX 1080’s using an SLI bridge, to really get the same amount of fps in 4k, as the 1070 in Full HD.</p>
                <p>So, a single GTX 1080 will not really give you the true 4k experience as it is often advertised as. But merely a taste of what it could be.</p>
                <h3>Monitor</h3>
                <p>If you are looking to get more than 60 fps on your games, you will have to make sure that your monitor supports more than 60 hertz, which is the current standard.</p>
                <p>Gamers are slowly starting to upgrade their monitors to 140 or 180 hertz, to get those extra hertz matching up with their graphics cards abilities. Some even go as far as 240 fps, which is the maximum number of frames, where a trained human eye can still tell a difference.</p>
